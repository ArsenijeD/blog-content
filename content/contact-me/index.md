## Lets get in touch

Hi! Do you want to ask me something? Great! Feel free to use the contact form or the good old email way. The form's contents send to an Azure Function, which validates it to see if it is not spam. To keep my inbox as clean as possible. 

**If you try to contact me, please keep the following in mind**:

- I do not accept any guest articles on my blog;
- I am not interested in hiring someone to do changes to my blogs like hiring a developer, web designer, or SEO specialist;
- I *might* do a product review if the product catches my interest. Please do not be offended when I say no;
- **Very important**: Please ask your questions in English or Dutch.

Are you ok with this? Great, feel free to reach out via mail: [elio@struyfconsulting.be](mailto:elio@struyfconsulting.be).
