Over his career, he has been invited to numerous cities including Barcelona, London, Paris, and Stockholm, where he has spoken on thought-provoking, development-related topics on Microsoft 365, SharePoint, and Azure DevOps. His extensive knowledge has seen him recognized as a Microsoft MVP eight times, twice as a GitHub Star, and he has been recognized as a SharePoint/Microsoft 365 Top 25 Influencer four times.

<!-- ### Long version

Elio Struyf is an independent Belgium-based Engineering Lead, Blogger, and Public Speaker whose tenacity, determination, and drive have all earned him the reputation as a trusted thought leader in the information technology space. Deeply passionate about what he does for a living, he is a firm believer in following your dreams no matter what. To him, one’s profession should also be their purpose. Furthermore, he believes that we only have this one life to live, so we should spend that life feeling truly fulfilled both professionally and personally.

Throughout the last decade, Elio has gained extensive experience in Azure, Microsoft 365, and Visual Studio Code extension development. Within those +10 years, he was deemed a Microsoft MVP seven consecutive times, he became a GitHub Star, and has been recognized as a SharePoint/Office 365 Top 25 Influencer three times.

Elio’s inspiration for his blog began back in 2010 when he was facing a challenge that took him several days to overcome. The moment he found that solution, he realized how much he wanted to share his findings with the world. That’s when his blog was born. Fast-forward two years, and he expanded his horizons by dabbling in the public speaking arena. After speaking at a local BIWUG community (https://biwug.be) event and becoming their VP a year later, he knew this was yet another way he could not only connect with others but share valuable knowledge with them. What was once a fear of public speaking ultimately turned into an obsession.

When he isn’t helping fellow IT developers, you can find Elio Struyf on his bike, coding, gaming (the Final Fantasy games are his favorite), binge-watching anime, or building random structures with Legos.  -->
