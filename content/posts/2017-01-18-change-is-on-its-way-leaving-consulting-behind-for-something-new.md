For the past eight years, I worked as a consultant for [Xylos](https://www.xylos.com) and [Ventigrate](http://www.ventigrate.be). I loved my job, I had great colleagues and worked on interesting projects. I am grateful for the opportunities and support I got while working for these companies.

For some time now, I was thinking of heading in another direction. After a lot of consideration, I decided to proceed my career as a trainer. Because one of my passions is learning new things and sharing knowledge with others, I accepted a job opportunity from U2U.

## Looking back at Ventigrate

From the first day, back in August 2014, Ventigrate gave me the freedom to do what I like. They allowed me to speak at 23 events which were mostly abroad, for which I am thankful.

When moving to another company, you always leave some great people behind. I am sure we will see each other again and I wish my colleagues all the best!

## Training at U2U

2017 will be a year of change and it will all start in February. As of then, I will become a trainer at [U2U](https://www.u2u.be/). I have always loved to share knowledge and interact with people. This job allows me to do this on a daily base. Best of all, U2U will also support me to speak at conferences or community events.

See you at an event or training later this year!
