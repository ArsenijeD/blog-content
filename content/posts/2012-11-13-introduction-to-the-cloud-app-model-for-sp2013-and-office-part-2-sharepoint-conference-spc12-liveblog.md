In part 2 of this 2 part series, we will take a deeper dive into apps for Office and SharePoint. This session will focus on authentication scenarios, user experience guidance and general best practices in developing apps for Office and SharePoint. This session will take the apps from Part 1, and enhance them so that they demonstrate the best practices and guidance outlined in this session.

Session is given by Keenan Newton, Eray Chou.
