On the first of September 2020, the [PnP team](https://pnp.github.io/) organized its first virtual conference. The conference had lots of great sessions, and I am sure you would have had a hard time picking the sessions you wanted to follow. You know what they say, choosing is losing. Actually, that is not true. You always gain something, no matter what you picked. The good news is that all sessions were recorded and are now available for you to watch on the Youtube channel of [Microsoft 365 & SharePoint Community - PnP](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_mKdhw-V6CeCM7gTo_Iy7w).

## My session at PnP Virtual Conference

I also did a session at the conference about UI Testing. In this session, I showed how you could quickly get started with UI Testing in SharePoint and Microsoft Teams.

**Session abstract**

Testing, testing, and testing. Testing is the key to the success of building great solutions, but eventually, things might fail. Are you prepared for it? These problems could be related to a new implementation that you did incorrectly or changed on the platform. Being prepared for these changes is very important. UI Testing provides you this capability, but it is not a click-click solution. You will require some tools and practices to get you started.

In this session, Elio will guide you through the process of setting up a UI testing process with Cypress, writing your first tests, and showing the results to your developers and testers. Are you interested in how UI testing can improve your quality? Come and check out this session.
