Learn how to create beautiful search experiences not only in your search centers but also in your portals using the new Content Search Web Part. We will show how Display Templates that use HTML and JavaScript make creating great custom experiences easy. We will also talk about the innovative new search capabilities like Result Types in SharePoint 2013 which allows search to not just understand the query, but adapt the experience to help users find what they are looking for quickly, get answers and take action.

This session is given by Kerem Yuceturk.
