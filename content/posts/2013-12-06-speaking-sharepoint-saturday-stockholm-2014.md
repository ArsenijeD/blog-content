On the 25th of January 2014, I'll be speaking at the first [SharePoint Saturday Stockholm](http://www.spsstockholm.com/2014/ "SharePoint Saturday Stockholm") (SPSSTHLM). This will also my first foreign speaker opportunity. Therefore, I would like to thank [Hannah Swain](https://twitter.com/hannahrswain), [Matthias Einig](https://twitter.com/mattein), and [Erwin van Hunen](https://twitter.com/knowsharepoint) for giving me this opportunity by accepting my submission.

The speakers line-up is amazing, it will be hard to choose which sessions to follow. My colleague [Thomas Vochten](https://twitter.com/thomasvochten "Thomas Vochten") and fellow [BIWUG](http://www.biwug.be "BIWUG") board member [Jethro Seghers](https://twitter.com/jseghers "Jethro Seghers") are also be speakers at the first SPSSTHLM.

I'll be talking about my passion from the last months: Display Templates.

**Farewell XSL, Welcome Display Templates**

Almost everything was built with XSL in SharePoint 2010, but this technology is a little bit outdated in SharePoint 2013. In this session we will focus on Display Templates. Display Templates leverage HTML and JavaScript instead of XSL to present is content. This new technology is widely used in SharePoint 2013, so this session will be a good starting point if you want to know more about Display Templates. You will learn where and for what these Display Templates are used, and how to create and modify Display Templates. So if HTML and JavaScript is something familiar for you, and want to know more on how you can brand certain elements, than this session is something for you.

PS: special thanks to my wife for letting me leave the country on here birthday.
