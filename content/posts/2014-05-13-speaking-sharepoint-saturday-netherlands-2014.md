At the last moment, I was asked to speak on the SharePoint Saturday Netherlands. Someone canceled his speakers slot, and that way this opened up a place for me.

This will also be my first SPSNL that I'll attend, the previous years I always had a personal appointment planned (this year also but was cancelled, that was why my submission was a bit too late). So I'm very eager to go to my very first SPSNL.

Mirjam and Marianne have chosen my **Farewell XSL, Welcome Display Templates** session.

More information about the event can be found over here:

My session is from 15:15 - 16:30 in Singapore.

## Farewell XSL, Welcome Display Templates

Almost everything was built with XSL in SharePoint 2010, but this technology is a little bit outdated in SharePoint 2013. In this session we will focus on Display Templates. Display Templates leverage HTML and JavaScript instead of XSL to present is content. This new technology is widely used in SharePoint 2013, so this session will be a good starting point if you want to know more about Display Templates. You will learn where and for what these Display Templates are used, and how to create and modify Display Templates. So if HTML and JavaScript is something familiar for you, and want to know more on how you can brand certain elements, than this session is something for you.
